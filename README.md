### Global Food Security Index
Indicators= Affordability + Availability + Quality & Safety+ Natural Resource & Resilience
Initial Questions:
1. How do Affordability, availability, quality & safety and natural resource & resilience
affect the Global Food Security Index?
2. What is the factor that lead to the country to have lowest GFSI score on average 10
years?
3. What is the factor that lead to the country to have highest GFSI score on average 10
years?

### How to use this Repository
1. run the ipynb file in jupyter notebook or jupyter lab (kernel: python)
2. dont forget to call the gfsi csv file
3. lets do the analysis !!!

### To answer Question 1, we did two test which is
1. Correlation test
2. Kruskal test

### and to answer questions 2 and 3,
we run these tests to see which factors lead to the GFSI scores:

1. WILCOXON SIGNED-RANK TEST
2. VALUE DIFFERENT BETWEEN FACTORS

We calculate the value different from both countries to find the factors that lead Ireland to
have the highest GFSI score meanwhile, Congo to have lowest GFSI score on average 10
years.
